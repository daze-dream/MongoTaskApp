stands for Representational State Transfer API
API is simply tools that let you build an application. Very broad.

lets client use and manipulate resources using premade functions
building a front end for something they want users to mess with

Representation: simply a representation of what's in the database
State Transfer: state transferred from server to client (data, operations, authentication)

So what functions do we need to expose to the client? For our task...
    Create: POST /tasks
    Read: GET /tasks(/:id for one single task)
    Update: PATCH /tasks/:id
    Delete: DELETE /tasks/:id
